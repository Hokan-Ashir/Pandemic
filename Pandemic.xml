 This method is used to draw barycenter (and so as stars) in such way
 that arc of barycenter-circle movement will suffice length of day on this latitude in this day of year
 i.e: 
 Let we stand on equator (latitude = 0) and calculated sunrise/sunset times are 6h and 18h respectively
 We take sun sphere with radius 1 (see comment to "pos" field in Astro.h in Esenthel Engine headers)
 Thus angle of rising sun will be 0, and angle of setting sun will be 180
 
			   ...
  /					   
 /						
 r - - - - - - - - - - - s - - - - horizon
 \						/
  \					   /
			   ...

 where "r" is position of rising sun, "s" - position of setting sun

 As we go to the North or to the South sunrise/sunset times changes
 i.e:
 Let we stand on 45N deg and calculated sunrise/sunset times are 8h and 16h respectively
 So position of the sun (relative to equator circle) in this hours will be:

   /					  
  r					   s
 /						
 | - - - - - - - - - - - -| - - - - horizon
 \						/
  \					   /
		 		...

 BUT to manage fact that sun rise and set on line of horizon we adjust horizon line
 in a way that "r" and "s" positions will still be on horizon

 	  /					  
   r - - - - - - - - - - s - - - - new horizon
  /			| r`		
 | - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - horizon
 \						/
  \					   /

 And this method calculate offset of this modified horizon "r`"
 So, to get new real position of barycenter on 45N degree latitude,
 we subtract "r`" from barycenter Y-position
 Calculation formula taken from http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSector.html
 in this link it is referenced as "h"

 \param Flt worldLatitude latitude of world in which barycenter offset will be calculated
 \return Flt calculated offset
